Puzzle pieces
=============

This is here as a visual aid, because sometimes having to alt-tab to a
JPEG is too much of a pain.

To the right of each is its "envelope", as I'm calling it (there's
probably a de-facto name for this already, but I haven't really read
any of the CS literature that might interesect with this problem).

So it seems there are only four different envelope shapes for the set
of pieces in this problem, which may help simplify things (it's too
early to tell).

Anyhow, I'm only using them to determine the extreme upper-left and
lower-right corners for each shape, so I know where to begin iterating
over the containing area (I did mention this is a bruteforce approach,
right?).
