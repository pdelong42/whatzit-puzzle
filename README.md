This is going to be my brute-force attempt at finding the solutions to
my son's "What'zit" puzzle.  Look in the docs directory for the photos
of the solutions sheet.  It would be nice to convert this to a more
convenient format for the long-term, like ASCII graphics or SVG
(anyone know a good, free OCR tool?).

I'm going to be attempting to find all of the 8x8 solutions.  At a
bare minimum, I would expect to find the four solutions they provide -
this would be a test of whether my code works at all.

I would also expect to get a number of duplicate solutions as well,
based on the fact that there will be four equivalent rotations of each
unique solution.  I don't yet know how I'm going to detect duplicates
(through rotations, etc.), so this is a limitation of my current plan.

Maybe if I'm feeling even more ambitious, I'll try the 3D solutions as
well.
